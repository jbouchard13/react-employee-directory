### Description

Use this full stack React app to sort and keep track of your employees. Users can sort the employee results by their first or last name, as well as by job titles. The buttons on top of the table of employees allow the sorting functions to run when clicked. New employees can also be added to the database under the Employee Management page. The app with a React front end as well as an Express backend linked to a MongoDB using Mongoose. The initial data was seeded from a seed file with information about the employees on the show The Office.

### Installation

Users can clone down the repository and open two bash/terminal windows. This way they can run both the front end React build as well as the proxy server connection for the backend. In the client folder the user just has to type "npm run start" to initialize the React front end. Inside the root directory the user can then type "node server" in the other window to fire up the backend server and establish the connection to the mongodb. If desired, the user can also run the "npm run seed" script to fill their local db with the seeded information. Otherwise the user can head to the deployed link specified above.

### Usage

As a manager of a team of employees, I want to be able to quickly access a directory of information about my team.
